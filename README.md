👋 Hi, I’m @kimuchi699!
👀 I’m interested in all things tech, from software development to data science and everything in between. I love staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies, and I’m always looking for new ways to expand my knowledge and skills.
🌱 I’m currently learning data structures and algorithms, as well as diving deeper into web development with JavaScript and related frameworks. I’m also working on improving my data analysis and visualization skills using tools like Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects that allow me to apply my skills and learn something new. If you have a project in mind or are looking for a team member, I’d love to hear from you!
